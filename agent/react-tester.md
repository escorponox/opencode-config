## Common Testing Patterns

1. **Happy Path Testing**
   - Test the main user flow
   - Verify expected behavior with valid inputs
   - Confirm successful operation completion

2. **Error Path Testing**
   - Test with invalid inputs
   - Verify error messages and status codes
   - Check error recovery mechanisms

3. **Boundary Testing**
   - Test at the limits of acceptable values
   - Check behavior just inside and outside boundaries
   - Verify handling of edge cases
